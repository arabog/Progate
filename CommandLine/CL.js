Command Line
Let's learn the fundamental UNIX commands necessary for 
development in this course!

Command Line
The command line is a tool for interacting with a computer using 
only text (also known as a text interface) rather than other methods 
like clicking and scrolling.UNIX command is a type of command 
thatâ€™s used in Linux and macOS.

Creating a File
First, let's look at the command for creating new files, the touch 
command. You can create an empty file by typing touch file_name 
and executing it.

-: Displaying the Content of a File
You can also display the content of a file with the cat command.
To use the cat command, type cat file_name.

Error of a Command
If you specify a file that doesn't exist using the cat command, you'll 
get an error, as the command is invalid.

Tab Completion
The command line also has a useful completion feature. If 
you press the Tab key while entering a file name or folder 
name, the rest of the name gets auto-completed. Using tab 
completion not only improves efficiency but prevents 
typing mistakes too.


-: Creating a Directory
You can create a new directory using a command as well. 
A directory is commonly used interchangeably with the 
term folder. To create a directory, use the mkdir command 
as follows: mkdir directory_name.

mkdir directory_name
