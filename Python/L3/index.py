# Python â…¢
# In this lesson, we'll learn how to use functions and modules.
# To keep things interesting, let's do this while creating a Rock 
# Paper Scissors game.


# -: Functions
# First of all, we'll take a look how functions work in Python. A 
# function is a piece of code that executes a specific task. print 
# is one example of a function. It allows you to print text easily 
# without needing to write a lot of code.

# Defining a Function
# Let's learn how to define a basic function. The syntax for defining 
# a function is as follows: def function_name():. Keep in mind that 
# you need to indent the code inside the function.

# def function_name:
#           sm code 

# def greet():
#           print('Hello')

# Calling Functions
# Since functions aren't executed just by defining them, you need 
# to call them to execute the code in the function. To call a function, 
# simply write function_name(). Keep in mind that a function can 
# only be called after it's been defined.

def greet():
          print('Hello')

greet()


# -: What is an Argument?
# You can pass values to a function when you call it. These values 
# are called arguments and they can be used inside the function. 
# By using arguments, you can make a function return different 
# values depending on the argument passed.

# To pass an argument to a function, the function has to have 
# a variable, called a parameter, to receive it. In the example below, 
# the greet function has the name parameter to receive an argument.

def greet(name):
          print('Hello ' + name)

# Passing an Argument to a Function
# We can pass an argument by calling a function like so: 
# function_name(argument). When the function is called, the 
# passed argument is assigned to the parameter to be used inside 
# the function.

def greet(name):
          print('Hello ' + name)

greet('John')
greet('Kate')

# Scope
# Variables have a scope, which refers to the specific range in 
# which a variable can be accessed. The scope of parameters 
# and variables defined inside a function is limited to the 
# function. Therefore, they cannot be used outside the function.

def greet(name):
          print(name)

# print(name)         #NameError: name 'name' is nt defined


# -: Functions with Multiple Parameters
# You can add multiple parameters to a function by separating 
# them with a comma ,. In the example below, name is the 1st 
# parameter, and message is the 2nd.

def greet(name, message):
          print(name + ', ' + message)

# Passing Multiple Arguments to a Function
# The example below shows how to pass multiple arguments to 
# a function. When passing in arguments like in the example 
# below, they must be in the same order as the parameters.

def greet(name, message):
          print(name + ', ' + message)

greet('John', 'nice to meet you')


# -: Default Parameter Values
# You can set the default value of a parameter. The default 
# will be used when no argument for the parameter is provided.

def greet(name, message = 'nice to meet you'):
          print(name + ', ' + message)

greet('John', 'see you again')
greet('Kate')


# -: Rock Paper Scissors
# So far, we've learned the basics of functions. Now, let's use 
# them to enhance the Rock Paper Scissors game.

# Receiving the User Name
# Let's first get the user's name, then print it.

          def print_hand(hand, name='Guest'):
          print(name + ' picked: ' + hand)

player_name = input('Please enter your name: ')
print_hand('Rock', player_name)

# -: Picking a Hand
# Let's let the user pick a hand with numbers 0, 1, or 2. We'll 
# prepare a list that contains 'Rock', 'Paper', and 'Scissors', 
# and when a user picks a number, we'll print the element that
# has the corresponding index number.

def print_hand(hand):
          hands = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']

          print(name + ' picked: ' + hands[hand])

# -------------------------
def print_hand(hand, name='Guest'):
          # Assign a list of hands to the hands variable
          hands = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
          
          # Update using an element of the hands variable
          print(name + ' picked: ' + hands[hand])

print('Starting the Rock Paper Scissors game!')
player_name = input('Please enter your name: ')

# Print 'Pick a hand: (0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors)'
print('Pick a hand: (0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors)')


# Get input, convert it, and assign it to the player_hand variable
player_hand = int(input('Please enter a number (0-2): '))
# player_hand = int(player_hand)

# Change the first argument to player_hand
print_hand(player_hand, player_name)


# -: Validating the Input Value
# Our current program throws an error if the user enters a value 
# other than 0, 1, or 2, so we need to validate it. In order to do 
# this, we'll cover our next topic, the return value.

# What is a Return Value?
# When we want to use the output of a function, we can use 
# return. In the example below, if 1 is passed to the validate 
# function, True is returned.

def validate(hand):
          if hand < 0 or hand > 2:
                    return False
          else:
                    return True

# Receiving a Return Value
# To send a value to the origin of the function call, we use 
# the return statement. By writing return value, the value 
# can be returned to be used outside of the function.

is_valid = validate(1)
print(is_valid)               #True

# Using a Return Value in an if Statement
# When a function with a return value is used as the condition 
# in an if statement, the returned value will be used to evaluate 
# the if statement.

if validate(player_hand):
          # process wn return value is True
else:
          # process wn return value is False

# Simplifying Conditional Statements
# For this case, we can skip writing == True in the conditional statements.

if validate(player_hand) == True:
if validate(player_hand):

# Since the validate function returns a Boolean value, we can 
# use it as the condition for our if/else statement.

# Define the validate function
def validate(hand):
          # Add control flow based on the value hand
          if hand < 0 or hand > 2:
                    return False
          else:
                    return True


def print_hand(hand, name='Guest'):
          hands = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
          print(name + ' picked: ' + hands[hand])

print('Starting the Rock Paper Scissors game!')
player_name = input('Please enter your name: ')

print('Pick a hand: (0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors)')
player_hand = int(input('Please enter a number (0-2): '))

# Add control flow based on the return value of the validate function
if validate(player_hand):
          print_hand(player_hand, player_name)
else:
          print('Please enter a valid number')


# -: How Return Works
# Not only does return send back the return value to the caller, 
# it also stops the function immediately. This means that anything 
# that comes after return in the function won't be executed.

def add(a, b):
          return a + b
          print("Hello World")

sum = add(1, 3)
print(sum)
# Hello World will not be printed

# Multiple Returns
# By adding control flow, you can use return multiple times. 
# In the example below, if the value of the name parameter 
# is equal to 'Guest', the function exits after returning 'What 
# is your name?'. The code after that won't be executed.

def greet(name = "Guest"):
          if name == "Guest":
                    return 'What is your name?'

          return name + ', welcome'

print(greet())
# only What is your name will be printed

def validate(hand):
          if hand < 0 or hand > 2:
                    return False
          # Remove else and fix indentation
          return True

def print_hand(hand, name='Guest'):
          hands = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
          print(name + ' picked: ' + hands[hand])

print('Starting the Rock Paper Scissors game!')
player_name = input('Please enter your name: ')

print('Pick a hand: (0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors)')
player_hand = int(input('Please enter a number (0-2): '))

if validate(player_hand):
          print_hand(player_hand, player_name)
else:
          print('Please enter a valid number')


-: The Rock Paper Scissors App
# We'll be adding functions to let the user compete against 
# the computer, and we'll learn about modules as well.

# Playing a Hand
# Let's start by printing the hand picked by the computer.

def validate(hand):
          if hand < 0 or hand > 2:
                    return False
          return True

def print_hand(hand, name='Guest'):
          hands = ['Rock', 'Paper', 'Scissors']
          print(name + ' picked: ' + hands[hand])

print('Starting the Rock Paper Scissors game!')
player_name = input('Please enter your name: ')

print('Pick a hand: (0: Rock, 1: Paper, 2: Scissors)')
player_hand = int(input('Please enter a number (0-2): '))

if validate(player_hand):
          # Assign 1 to the computer_hand variable
          computer_hand = 1
          
          print_hand(player_hand, player_name)
          # Call print_hand function with computer_hand and 'Computer' as arguments
          print_hand(computer_hand, 'Computer')

else:
          print('Please enter a valid number')


# -: Judging the Winner
# Define the judge function
def judge(player, computer):
          # Add control flow based on the comparison of player and computer
          if player == computer:
                    return 'Draw'
          elif player == 0 and computer == 1:
                    return 'Lose'
          elif player == 1 and computer == 2:
                    return 'Lose'
          elif player == 2 and computer == 0:
                    return 'Lose'
          else:
                    return 'Win'


if validate(player_hand):
          computer_hand = 1
          
          print_hand(player_hand, player_name)
          print_hand(computer_hand, 'Computer')
          
          # Assign the return value of judge to the result variable
          result = judge(player_hand, computer_hand)
          # Print the result variable
          print('Result: ' + result)
else:
          print('Please enter a valid number')


# -: Dividing Files
# The code in our script.py file has become very long. As 
# your code gets longer, it becomes harder to read and 
# comprehend, and could lead you to unwanted bugs. 
# To prevent this, let's learn how to divide code into 
# separate files.

# Modules
# We can move parts of our code to a separate file, and import it as a module. A module is a file that can be imported into another file.
# By importing a module, you can use the functions in that module.

# import
# You can import a module using the following syntax: 
# import module_name. The extension of the file, .py, can 
# be trimmed when you import it.

# utils.py
def validate(hand):

def print_hand(hand, name = 'Guest')

def judge(player, computer)

# import utils

# Using Modules
# You can call a function of a module by putting the name of the 
# module before the function name, like 
# module_name.function_name().

import utils

if utils.validate(player_hand):
          computer = 1
          
          utils.print_hand(player_hand, player_name)

# Let's move the functions to utils.py, and import them as modules.

# -: Completing the Rock Paper Scissors App
# Finally, let's make the game more exciting by making the 
# computer's hand random.

# Python Standard Library
# Earlier, we learned how to create a custom utils module. 
# Python also has a list of built-in modules that you can use 
# in the Python Standard Library. Let's try using one of these 
# very useful modules.

# Python Standard Library: math, random, datetime

The random Module
We'll be randomizing the hand chosen by the computer using 
the randint function from the random module. By writing 
random.randint(x, y), you can get a random integer between 
x and y inclusive.

import utils
import random

if utils.validate(player_hand):
          computer_hand = random.randint(0, 2)
