# Python â…¢
# In this lesson, we'll learn how to use functions and modules.
# To keep things interesting, let's do this while creating a Rock 
# Paper Scissors game.


# -: Functions
# First of all, we'll take a look how functions work in Python. A 
# function is a piece of code that executes a specific task. print 
# is one example of a function. It allows you to print text easily 
# without needing to write a lot of code.

# Defining a Function
# Let's learn how to define a basic function. The syntax for defining 
# a function is as follows: def function_name():. Keep in mind that 
# you need to indent the code inside the function.

# def function_name:
#           sm code 

# def greet():
#           print('Hello')

# Calling Functions
# Since functions aren't executed just by defining them, you need 
# to call them to execute the code in the function. To call a function, 
# simply write function_name(). Keep in mind that a function can 
# only be called after it's been defined.

def greet():
          print('Hello')

greet()
