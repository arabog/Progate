# Strings
# In Python, a sequence of characters, like "Hello Python", is 
# known as a string. A string needs to be enclosed in single ' 
# or double " quotes. The output will be the same either way. 
# If you don't put the characters in quotes, you'll get an error.

# Comments

# Comments will not be executed when running code, so you can 
# use them to leave notes.
