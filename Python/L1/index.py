# About Python
# Python is a programming language that's simple and easy 
# to understand. It's used in web development, machine learning, 
# statistic processing, and more.

# -: 
# You can display characters by using print(). Characters inside 
# the parentheses will be displayed in the console.

print("Hello Python");

# Strings
# In Python, a sequence of characters, like "Hello Python", is 
# known as a string. A string needs to be enclosed in single ' 
# or double " quotes. The output will be the same either way. 
# If you don't put the characters in quotes, you'll get an error.

# Comments
# Adding # at the beginning will make the entire line a comment.
# Comments will not be executed when running code, so you can 
# use them to leave notes.


# -: Integers
# You can use numbers like integers in programming. Unlike strings, 
# they don't need to be enclosed in quotes. You can add and subtract 
# integers just like you do in math. 

print(3 + 7);
print(3 - 7);

# Difference between Strings and Integers
# Strings and integers are interpreted differently in programming. 
# Like the images below, 3 + 5 will print 8, which is the result of 
# the addition. However, if you enclose the addition in quotes and 
# make it a string, the output will stay as 3 + 5.

print(3 + 5);
print("3 + 5");
