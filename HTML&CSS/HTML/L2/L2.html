          Basic Layout
          <header> and <footer>
          Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
          Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like 
          we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, 
          which are more commonly used.

          background-image
          The top section has an image in the background.
          We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, 
          like background-image: url(URL);.

          background-size
          The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it
          fills the whole space.
          If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

          Centering the Elements
          Let's horizontally center the container class.
          We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
          Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.
