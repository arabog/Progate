          Basic Layout
          <header> and <footer>
          Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
          Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like 
          we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, 
          which are more commonly used.

          background-image
          The top section has an image in the background.
          We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, 
          like background-image: url(URL);.

          background-size
          The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it
          fills the whole space.
          If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

          Centering the Elements
          Let's horizontally center the container class.
          We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
          Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.

          Opacity and Letter Spacing:
          opacity:
          To make an element transparent, you can use the opacity property.
          You can specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
          
          opacity: 0.7:

          letter-spacing
          The letter-spacing property can be used to specify the space between the letters.

          letter-spacing: 5px;

          Creating Buttons
          Now let's create some buttons using <a> tags.
          Since the <a> tag is an inline element, we can't specify its size and space.
          Let's find out how to solve this.

          Inline-block Elements
          Inline-block elements have the characteristics of both block-level elements 
          and inline elements. Like inline elements, they will be aligned horizontally, 
          but you can also specify their size and spacing, like block elements.

          display
          <a> tags are inline elements by default, but you can use the display 
          property to change this.
          The display property can have block, inline-block or inline specified.
          
          Specifying Multiple Classes
          If you have several elements that have slightly different CSS, you 
          can extract the common CSS and the individual CSS to different 
          classes, and specify them both.
          You can specify multiple classes by separating them with a space.

          <div class="btn blue"></div>

          <div class="btn red"></div>

          .btn {
                    <!-- common css -->
          }

          .blue {
                    color: blue;
          }

          .red {
                    color: red;
          }

</body>
