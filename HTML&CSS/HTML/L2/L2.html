          Basic Layout
          <header> and <footer>
          Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
          Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like 
          we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, 
          which are more commonly used.

          background-image
          The top section has an image in the background.
          We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, 
          like background-image: url(URL);.

          background-size
          The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it
          fills the whole space.
          If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

          Centering the Elements
          Let's horizontally center the container class.
          We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
          Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.

          Opacity and Letter Spacing:
          opacity:
          To make an element transparent, you can use the opacity property.
          You can specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
          
          opacity: 0.7:

          letter-spacing
          The letter-spacing property can be used to specify the space between the letters.

          letter-spacing: 5px;

          Creating Buttons
          Now let's create some buttons using <a> tags.
          Since the <a> tag is an inline element, we can't specify its size and space.
          Let's find out how to solve this.

          Inline-block Elements
          Inline-block elements have the characteristics of both block-level elements 
          and inline elements. Like inline elements, they will be aligned horizontally, 
          but you can also specify their size and spacing, like block elements.

          display
          <a> tags are inline elements by default, but you can use the display 
          property to change this.
          The display property can have block, inline-block or inline specified.
          
          Specifying Multiple Classes
          If you have several elements that have slightly different CSS, you 
          can extract the common CSS and the individual CSS to different 
          classes, and specify them both.
          You can specify multiple classes by separating them with a space.

          <div class="btn blue"></div>

          <div class="btn red"></div>

          .btn {
                    <!-- common css -->
          }

          .blue {
                    color: blue;
          }

          .red {
                    color: red;
          }

          Adjusting the Layout
          Let's adjust the layout of the top section by focusing on the following:
          ・Changing the button color when the cursor is hovering over it
          ・Making the corners of the buttons rounded
          ・Aligning the text to the center

          :hover
          When the cursor is on an element, the element is in the hover state.
          By adding the :hover selector, we can specify the CSS for when an 
          element is in the hover state.
          Make sure you do not put spaces on either side of the :.

          border-radius
          We use the border-radius property to round the corners of elements. 
          The larger the number, the rounder the corners become.

          text-align
          The text-align property lets you align inline and inline-block elements.
          Values left, center, or right can be specified.

          margin: 0 auto and text-align: center
          We learned that both margin: 0 auto and text-align: center can be used 
          to center elements. Let's look at the differences between the two. We 
          use margin for block-level elements like containers, and text-align 
          for inline and inline-block elements like buttons and text.

          text-align: center;


          Using Icons:
          Font Awesome
          You can easily add icons by using Font Awesome.
          It has a lot of icons that you can use in your web page.
          Check out https://fontawesome.com/ for the list of icons that you can use.

          Using Font Awesome
          You can use Font Awesome in the following steps.
          1. Load the Font Awesome CSS inside the <head> tag
          2. Add a <span> tag with the classes fa and fa-icon-name
          (You can find the icon name in the Font Awesome page.)

          <head>
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
          </head>

          <body>
                    <span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>

                    <span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>
          </body>


          opacity and rgba
          We've previously used opacity to make an element transparent.
          But the problem with opacity is that it makes the entire element 
          transparent, including all the child elements.
          If we only want the background color to be transparent, we can 
          use rgba.

          rgb
          To learn about rgba, we must first understand the rgb.
          rgb is a way to specify the color with a combination of three values.
          It works just like the hexadecimal format (e.g. #ffffff)

          rgba
          rgba is used when you want to specify the transparency of the color.
          You specify four values for rgba, and the fourth value specifies the 
          transparency from 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
          The example below shows the difference between rgba and opacity.

          <div class="rgba-sample">
                    <p>rgba</p>
          </div>

          <div class="opacity-sample">
                    <p>opacity</p>
          </div>

          .rgba-sample {
                    background-color: rgba(84, 190, 238, 0.5); // only d bg bcoms transparent
          }

          .opacity-sample{
                    <!-- d elemt and its contents r transparent -->
                    background-color: rgb(84, 190, 238);

                    opacity: 0.5;
          }

          Improving the Login Link
          Let's improve the login link by:
          ・Adding some animation to the hover.
          ・Vertically centering the Log in text.

          transition
          The transition property can be used to add animations.
          You can specify the target and the duration of the animation.
          The target can be a property, like color, but we often just specify all so it applies to all properties.
          transition is often used with the hover selector.

          transition: all 0.5s;

          line-height
          The line-height property can be used to specify the height that the line occupies.

          Using line-height to Vertically Center Text
          line-height can also be used to vertically center text.
          Since the text will be placed in the center of the line-height, specifying 
          the same value for the height and the line-height will vertically center 
          the text inside.

          .btn {
                    height: 65px;
                    line-height: 65px;
          }

          Expanding the <a> Tag
          Since the <a> tag is an inline element, it only occupies the space of the 
          text. As a result, we can only click the text area of the button.
          We can fix this by making the <a> tag a block element, which spreads 
          to the size of its parent element.

          font-weight
          The font-weight property lets you change the thickness of the text.
          You can specify values like normal and bold.
          Since <h1>~<h6> tags have font-weight: bold; specified by default, 
          you can specify font-weight: normal; to change them back to normal.

          Specifying the Size With %
          By using % instead of px, we can calculate the width based on its 
          parent element's width. The same applies for the height property.

          <div class="parent">
                    <div class="child"></div>
                    <div class="child"></div>
          </div>

          .child {
                    width: 50%;         //parent will be width: 100%
          }

          Overlapping Elements
          Now let's adjust the layout of each lesson part.
          Normally in HTML, the elements never overlap.
          But you can do this by adding some CSS.
          In this exercise, we'll learn how to place some text on top of an image.

          position: absolute;
          You can use position: absolute; to make the elements overlap.
          With position: absolute; you can specify the position relative to the 
          top-left corner of the web page, using the top and left properties.

          .box1 {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 50px;
                    left: 70px;
          }

          .box2 {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 120px;
                    left: 140px;
          }

          position: relative;
          You can change the reference point for position: absolute
          by specifying position: relative; to an ancestor element.
          This way, the element with position: absolute specified will be 
          positioned relative to the top-left corner of the ancestor element.

          <div class="parent">
                    <img class="child" src="ken.jpg" >
          </div>

          .parent{
                    position: relative;
          }

          .child {
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 20px;
                    left: 15px;
          }

          N.B:
          /* Add CSS for lesson-icon */
          .lesson-icon {
                    position: relative;
          }


          /* Add CSS for <p> tags inside lesson-icon */
          .lesson-icon p{
                    position: absolute;
                    top: 90px;
                    width: 100%;        //?
                    color: white;
          }

          /* Add CSS for txt-contents */
          .txt-contents {
                    width: 80%;
                    display: inline-block;        //?
                    margin-top: 20px;
                    font-size: 15px;
                    color: #b3aeb5;
          }

          Creating a 3D Button
          Let's learn how to make the button look 3D by adding shadows to it.
          We'll also be learning how to change the mouse pointer type.

          box-shadow
          The box-shadow property is used to add shadows to elements.
          We can use it by specifying its horizontal length, vertical length, 
          and the color.

          .box {
                    box-shadow: 10px              10px                #000;
                                        horizontal          vertical            color
          }

          cursor:
          The cursor property can be used to change the type of the
          mouse pointer,. Some HTML tags like the <a> tag have the 
          cursor property set to pointer by default.

          cursor: text/pointer/default;

          message {
                    padding: 15px 40px;
                    background-color: #5dca88;

                    /* Change the cursor property to pointer */
                    cursor: pointer;

                    /* Change the box-shadow property */
                    box-shadow: 0 7px #1a7940;
          }

          Pressing a Button
          Let's add some more CSS to the button to make it look like it's 
          been pressed when you click on it.
          We can do this by doing the following things when the button is clicked.
          ・Remove the shadow
          ・Lowering the button by the length of the shadow

          :active
          The :active selector can be used to add CSS for when an element is 
          being clicked.

          <div>
                    <h1>Progate</h1>
          </div>

          div:active {
                    background-color: red;
          }

          Canceling CSS
          You can remove the shadow by specifying box-shadow: none;.
          Many CSS properties can be canceled by specifying none.

          Usage of position: relative;
          We previously learned how to use position: relative; with position: 
          absolute;, but its actual role is to position the element relative to its 
          normal position.

          div:active {
                    position: relative;
                    top:70px;
                    left: 10px;
          }

          Pressing a Button
          We'll add the following CSS to make the button look like it's been pressed.
          ・Set box-shadow to none
          ・Use position: relative; with top to lower the element by the length of 
          the shadow

          div:active {
                    position: relative;
                    top:7px;
                    
                    box-shadow: none;
          }
