          Basic Layout
          <header> and <footer>
          Many web pages have headers and footers, so HTML has tags for them.
          Instead of writing <div class="header"> and <div class="footer"> like 
          we did in the previous lesson, we can use the <header> and <footer> tags, 
          which are more commonly used.

          background-image
          The top section has an image in the background.
          We can specify this with CSS using the background-image property, 
          like background-image: url(URL);.

          background-size
          The image specified with background-image will repeat itself until it
          fills the whole space.
          If you want to fill it with a single image, you can specify background-size: cover;.

          Centering the Elements
          Let's horizontally center the container class.
          We can do this by specifying the left and right margins to auto.
          Note that you must also specify the width when doing so.

          Opacity and Letter Spacing:
          opacity:
          To make an element transparent, you can use the opacity property.
          You can specify a value between 0.0 and 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
          
          opacity: 0.7:

          letter-spacing
          The letter-spacing property can be used to specify the space between the letters.

          letter-spacing: 5px;

          Creating Buttons
          Now let's create some buttons using <a> tags.
          Since the <a> tag is an inline element, we can't specify its size and space.
          Let's find out how to solve this.

          Inline-block Elements
          Inline-block elements have the characteristics of both block-level elements 
          and inline elements. Like inline elements, they will be aligned horizontally, 
          but you can also specify their size and spacing, like block elements.

          display
          <a> tags are inline elements by default, but you can use the display 
          property to change this.
          The display property can have block, inline-block or inline specified.
          
          Specifying Multiple Classes
          If you have several elements that have slightly different CSS, you 
          can extract the common CSS and the individual CSS to different 
          classes, and specify them both.
          You can specify multiple classes by separating them with a space.

          <div class="btn blue"></div>

          <div class="btn red"></div>

          .btn {
                    <!-- common css -->
          }

          .blue {
                    color: blue;
          }

          .red {
                    color: red;
          }

          Adjusting the Layout
          Let's adjust the layout of the top section by focusing on the following:
          ・Changing the button color when the cursor is hovering over it
          ・Making the corners of the buttons rounded
          ・Aligning the text to the center

          :hover
          When the cursor is on an element, the element is in the hover state.
          By adding the :hover selector, we can specify the CSS for when an 
          element is in the hover state.
          Make sure you do not put spaces on either side of the :.

          border-radius
          We use the border-radius property to round the corners of elements. 
          The larger the number, the rounder the corners become.

          text-align
          The text-align property lets you align inline and inline-block elements.
          Values left, center, or right can be specified.

          margin: 0 auto and text-align: center
          We learned that both margin: 0 auto and text-align: center can be used 
          to center elements. Let's look at the differences between the two. We 
          use margin for block-level elements like containers, and text-align 
          for inline and inline-block elements like buttons and text.

          text-align: center;


          Using Icons:
          Font Awesome
          You can easily add icons by using Font Awesome.
          It has a lot of icons that you can use in your web page.
          Check out https://fontawesome.com/ for the list of icons that you can use.

          Using Font Awesome
          You can use Font Awesome in the following steps.
          1. Load the Font Awesome CSS inside the <head> tag
          2. Add a <span> tag with the classes fa and fa-icon-name
          (You can find the icon name in the Font Awesome page.)

          <head>
                    <link rel="stylesheet" href="//maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/font-awesome/4.3.0/css/font-awesome.min.css">
          </head>

          <body>
                    <span class="fa fa-facebook"></span>

                    <span class="fa fa-twitter"></span>
          </body>


          opacity and rgba
          We've previously used opacity to make an element transparent.
          But the problem with opacity is that it makes the entire element 
          transparent, including all the child elements.
          If we only want the background color to be transparent, we can 
          use rgba.

          rgb
          To learn about rgba, we must first understand the rgb.
          rgb is a way to specify the color with a combination of three values.
          It works just like the hexadecimal format (e.g. #ffffff)

          rgba
          rgba is used when you want to specify the transparency of the color.
          You specify four values for rgba, and the fourth value specifies the 
          transparency from 0.0 to 1.0, 0.0 being the most transparent.
          The example below shows the difference between rgba and opacity.

          <div class="rgba-sample">
                    <p>rgba</p>
          </div>

          <div class="opacity-sample">
                    <p>opacity</p>
          </div>

          .rgba-sample {
                    background-color: rgba(84, 190, 238, 0.5); // only d bg bcoms transparent
          }

          .opacity-sample{
                    <!-- d elemt and its contents r transparent -->
                    background-color: rgb(84, 190, 238);

                    opacity: 0.5;
          }
