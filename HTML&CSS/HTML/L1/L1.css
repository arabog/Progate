What is CSS?
CSS is used to design a website. With CSS, you can change 
hings like the color, size, and spacing of HTML elements.

How CSS Works
CSS is written in a separate file from HTML.
You can apply CSS to HTML elements by specifying "where," "what," 
and "how" you want to change it.
In the example below, CSS is applied to an <h1> element (the "where") 
and its color (the "what") is changed to red (the "how").
The target HTML element is called the selector.

<h1> Progate </h1>

h1 {      // where (selector)
          what      how
          color:    red;
          ppty      value
}

In CSS, colors are specified by hexadecimal values like color: #ff0000;

CSS Comments
Just as you did in HTML, you can write comments in a CSS file.
In CSS, however, a comment should be surrounded by /* */

/*

#Progate @progateEN @dev_careers #dev_careers
*/
