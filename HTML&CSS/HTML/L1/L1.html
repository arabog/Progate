                    How HTML Works
                    The first rule of writing HTML code is to surround text with tags.
                    Tags give a meaning, such as a heading or a link, to text.
                    <h1> Hello World </h1>

                    <a> Progate </a>

                    Opening and Closing Tags
                    Most HTML elements require a pair of tags, an opening tag 
                    and a closing tag, with text inserted in between.
                    When using closing tags, make sure to put /.

                    Heading Tags
                    Heading tags are used to format heading elements.
                    These tags range from <h1> to <h6>, <h1> being 
                    the largest and <h6> being the smallest (※ h stands for 
                    heading.).

                    Paragraph Tag
                    The <p> tag defines a paragraph (※ p stands for paragraph).
                    The text enclosed by tags such as <h2> and <p> begin on a 
                    new line.
                    <p> Hello </p>

                    Using Headings and Paragraphs
                    The <h1>...<h6> tags are used according to the size and 
                    importance of headings.
                    For text that is not a heading, let's use the <p> tag.

                    Comments
                    The text surrounded by <!-- --> becomes a comment.
                    Comments are not displayed in the browser, so they are 
                    useful for explaining your code.

                    <!-- this is a comment -->

                    <!-- 
                              Link Tag
                              You can easily create a link with the <a> tag (※ a stands 
                              for anchor).
                              The text in <a> tags is displayed in the browser as a link text.
                              <a> Home </a>

                              Every link has a destination.
                              So, in order to make any link work, you'll need to specify 
                              a destination URL in the <a> element by adding the href 
                              attribute.
                               <a href="url"> Home </a>

                               HTML Attributes
                              In HTML, you can specify an attribute like href in the opening tag.
                              Always put attribute values in double quotes.
                              href="url"> Home </a>

                              Image Tag
                              The <img> tag is used to display an image.
                              We can set the image by specifying the url in the src attribute as 
                              follows: <img src="url">.
                              Note that <img> tags don't require closing tags as they don't 
                              enclose any text.

                              <img src="https://progate.com/images/family.jpg"

                              Lists
                              You can create a list item by enclosing the text with <li> tags.
                                        
                              <li>HTML</li>
                              <li>PHP</li>
                              <li>Ruby</li>

                              The type of list items changes depending on the tag you use.
                              With the <ul> tag, you can create bulleted lists.

                              <ul>
                                        <li>HTML</li>
                                        <li>PHP</li>
                                        <li>Ruby</li>
                              </ul>
                              When elements are "nested" like this, the enclosing element becomes 
                              the parent and the enclosed elements become its children.

                              GO TO CSS SECTION

                              The Structure of HTML
                              In an actual HTML document, there are some rules you need to follow.
                              For example, the <head> and the <body> elements are required in 
                              the <html> element 

                              The <head> element contains information of the document while 
                              the <body> element contains the contents that are visible in the 
                              browser.

                              Specifying the HTML Version
                              In every HTML document, you need to start with the DOCTYPE 
                              declaration, which indicates the specific HTML version for your 
                              website.
                              We'll be using <!DOCTYPE html>, which is for HTML5, the 
                              latest version of HTML. Don't worry too much about the 
                              specific type, just remember that it's something you always 
                              have to specify.
                              
                              <head> Tag
                              The <head> element contains the settings of the HTML document 
                              that are not visible in the browser.
                              There are three elements you need to put in the <head> element.
                              Within the <head> element, we will specify 
                                        1) the character encoding, 
                                        2) the title of the website, and 
                                        3) the link to a CSS file.

                              <head>
                                        <meta charset="utf-8">

                                        <title> Progate </title>

                                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
                              </head>

                              Character Encoding
                              By specifying the character encoding in the charset attribute 
                              as <meta charset="utf-8">, you can prevent the website from garbling.
                              UTF-8 is the recommended character encoding for HTML5.

                              Title for Your Website
                              The <title> element specifies the title of the document.

                              Linking a CSS file
                              You need to create a link between an HTML and CSS file by defining 
                              <link rel="stylesheet"> in the HTML.
                              You can specify the name of the CSS file using the href attribute.

                              The Layout
                              Layout is one of the most important parts of building a website.
                              The layout of the website we're going to build is made up of mainly 
                              three parts as shown below.
                                        Header, Main, Footer

                              <div> Tag
                              We're going to create the layout with <div> elements ("div" 
                              stands for "division"). The <div> tag is used to group elements.
                              In the example below, the layout is divided by three <div> elements 
                              with class names header, main, and footer.

                              <div class="header"> </div>
                              <div class="main"> </div>
                              <div class="footer"> </div>

                              Tag Autocompletion (Web Only)
                              From here on, you'll be writing a lot of tags. So in order to prevent 
                              typing errors, let's use the editor's autocomplete function. You can 
                              enter a tag name and press the "tab" key to complete the tag 
                              (Depending on the tag, some extra attributes may be inserted, 
                              so please be careful).


                              The Header:
                              The Structure of the Header:
                              There is a "Progate" logo and a list.
                              Let's group these two parts using the <div> element 

                              <div class="header"> 
                                        <div class="header-logo"> Progate </div>

                                        <div class="header-list">
                                                  <ul>
                                                            <li></li>
                                                            <li></li>
                                                            <li></li>
                                                  </ul>
                                        </div>
                              </div>

                              Removing the Bullets from List Items:
                              By applying the list-style property on an <li> element, you can 
                              remove the bullet points. Since we don't want bullets for our list, 
                              let's set the list-style to none.

                              li {
                                        list-style: none; // removes d bullets 4rm <li>
                              }

                              Aligning the Header Horizontally
                              Generally, elements written in HTML are vertically aligned.
                              To horizontally align them, we need CSS.

                              The Float Property:
                              Using the float property, you can align targeted elements 
                              horizontally. Specifying float: left; will arrange elements 
                              side by side from left to right.

                              <ul>
                                        <li>HTML</li>
                                        <li>PHP</li>
                                        <li>Ruby</li>
                              </ul>

                              li {
                                        float: left;        //HTMLPHPRuby
                              }

                              Padding: Adjusting Spaces
                              Let's adjust the spaces between the elements in the header 
                              so that both the logo and header list are placed in the 
                              appropriate positions.

                              Adding Space to an Element
                              When you want to add some space to an element, the padding 
                              property comes in handy. By applying padding: 〇〇px;, the 
                              specified space is added to all sides of an element.
                              <div class="logo1">
                                        Progate
                              </div>

                              .logo1 {
                                        padding: 20px;      // adds 20px padding to all sides
                              }

                              Applying Padding to Only One Side
                              You may want to add padding to only one side of an element instead 
                              of all sides. In that case, you can apply padding independently by 
                              using properties like padding-top and padding-bottom.
                              For example, to add the top padding, set padding-top: 〇〇px;.

                              Padding Shorthand
                              You can use shorthand when applying padding.
                              You can apply padding to multiple sides using only one property.
                              When four values are defined, padding is applied clockwise from 
                              the top. When two values are defined, padding is applied in the 
                              order of "top / bottom" and "right / left".

                              The Footer
                              Next, we're going to work on the layout of the footer.
                              As with the header, let's check out the design and the structure.
                              On the left side of the footer is the logo, and on the right is the list.

                              The Structure of he Footer
                              When we created the header, we applied float and padding to every 
                              <li> element. Because of that, the CSS properties are also applied 
                              to the <li> elements in the footer.
                              How do you think we can apply these CSS properties only to the 
                              <li> tags in the header?

                              Nested Selectors
                              By adding li after header-list with a space in between, you can apply 
                              CSS to only the <li> elements in the header-list.
                              This allows you to apply different CSS to the <li> elements in the 
                              header from those in the footer.

                              .header-list li {
                                        color: #ff0000;
                              }

                              float: right
                              With float: right, you can horizontally align the targeted elements 
                              from right to left.


                              Positioning Elements Left and Right
                              By combining float: left; and float: right;, you can place the logo 
                              and the list in a row from left to right.
                              Let's apply float: left; to the footer-logo selector so that it is placed 
                              on the left edge. Also apply float: right; to the footer-list selector 
                              to move it to the right edge.

                              <div class="footer">
                                        <div class="footer-logo">Progate</div>
                                                  <div class="footer-list">
                                                            <ul>
                                                                      <li>About</li>
                                                                      <li>Jobs</li>
                                                                      <li>Contact us</li>
                                                            </ul>
                                                  </div>
                                        </div>
                              </div>


                              .footer {
                                        background-color: #2f5167;
                                        
                                        color: #fff;
                                        
                                        height: 120px;
                                        padding: 40px;
                              }

                              .footer-logo {
                                        font-size: 32px;
                                        float: left;
                              }

                              .footer-list{
                                        float: right;
                              }

                              .footer-list li { 
                                        padding-bottom: 20px;
                              }

                              The Main Layout
                              It consists of three elements, copy-container, contents, and 
                              contact-form.

                              <div class="copy-container"> </div>
                              <div class="contents"> </div>
                              <div class="contact-form"> </div>

                              Applying CSS to a Part of Text
                              <span> Tag
                              You can apply CSS to a part of a text by putting it in a <span> tag. 

                              Block-Level and Inline Elements
                              In HTML, some elements start on a new line while others don't.
                              Block-level elements like divs contain a new line before and after 
                              the element, and extend to the full width of their parent element.
                              Inline elements like spans only take up as much width as necessary.

                              The Content
                              First, let's make the layout of the content section.
                              We need the title and 4 contents-items.

                              <div class="content">
                                        <h3> Lessons </h3>

                                        <div class="contents-item">
                                                  <img src="">

                                                  <p> HTML & CSS </p>
                                        </div>
                              </div>

                              Syntax for Borders
                              You can add a border with the border property.
                              You can specify the thickness, style, and color.
                              Using the border property will apply a border 
                              to all sides. If you want to add it only to a specific 
                              side, use one of the following properties: border-bottom, 
                              border-top, border-left, or border-right.

                              Space Inside and Outside of Borders
                              Padding and Margin
                              Earlier, we used the padding property to create space around 
                              an element. However, the padding adds space inside its border.
                              The margin property, though, adds space outside the border
                              can specify the values just like you did for the padding.

                              The Box Model
                              The border, padding, and margin properties we've covered so far are 
                              based on the concept of the box model.
                              Every HTML element has a border (most are not visible by default).
                              The space outside the border is margin, and the inside is padding.

                              Forms:
                              single-line input field
                              multi-line input field
                              submit btn

                              <input> and <textarea> Tags
                              Let's see how to make input fields.
                              The <input> tag is used for receiving a single line of text while 
                              the <textarea> tag is suitable for a multiline text.
                              Note that the <input> tag doesn't require a closing tag.

                              Submit Button
                              We can also create a submit button by adding the type attribute 
                              to an <input> element. When you set the type attribute to submit, 
                              the <input> element becomes a submit button. By default, the text 
                              displayed on the button is "Submit" in English browsers.

                              Value Attribute
                              If you wish, you can change the text displayed on a submit button 
                              by specifying the value attribute.

                              <input type="submit" value="Send" >

                              Applying CSS to Multiple Selectors
                              You can group the same CSS by separating multiple selectors 
                              with a comma. By doing so, you can apply the same CSS to 
                              different selectors.
                              For our website, let's apply the same CSS to <input> and 
                              <textarea> elements using this method.

                              <h1> Hello World </h1>
                              <p> Welcome to Progate </p>

                              h1, p {
                                        color: #ff0000;
                              }

                    -->
          -->
</body>
</html>
