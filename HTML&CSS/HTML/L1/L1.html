                    How HTML Works
                    The first rule of writing HTML code is to surround text with tags.
                    Tags give a meaning, such as a heading or a link, to text.
                    <h1> Hello World </h1>

                    <a> Progate </a>

                    Opening and Closing Tags
                    Most HTML elements require a pair of tags, an opening tag 
                    and a closing tag, with text inserted in between.
                    When using closing tags, make sure to put /.

                    Heading Tags
                    Heading tags are used to format heading elements.
                    These tags range from <h1> to <h6>, <h1> being 
                    the largest and <h6> being the smallest (※ h stands for 
                    heading.).

                    Paragraph Tag
                    The <p> tag defines a paragraph (※ p stands for paragraph).
                    The text enclosed by tags such as <h2> and <p> begin on a 
                    new line.
                    <p> Hello </p>

                    Using Headings and Paragraphs
                    The <h1>...<h6> tags are used according to the size and 
                    importance of headings.
                    For text that is not a heading, let's use the <p> tag.

                    Comments
                    The text surrounded by <!-- --> becomes a comment.
                    Comments are not displayed in the browser, so they are 
                    useful for explaining your code.

                    <!-- this is a comment -->

                    <!-- 
                              Link Tag
                              You can easily create a link with the <a> tag (※ a stands 
                              for anchor).
                              The text in <a> tags is displayed in the browser as a link text.
                              <a> Home </a>

                              Every link has a destination.
                              So, in order to make any link work, you'll need to specify 
                              a destination URL in the <a> element by adding the href 
                              attribute.
                               <a href="url"> Home </a>

                               HTML Attributes
                              In HTML, you can specify an attribute like href in the opening tag.
                              Always put attribute values in double quotes.
                              href="url"> Home </a>

                              Image Tag
                              The <img> tag is used to display an image.
                              We can set the image by specifying the url in the src attribute as 
                              follows: <img src="url">.
                              Note that <img> tags don't require closing tags as they don't 
                              enclose any text.

                              <img src="https://progate.com/images/family.jpg"

                              Lists
                              You can create a list item by enclosing the text with <li> tags.
                                        
                              <li>HTML</li>
                              <li>PHP</li>
                              <li>Ruby</li>

                              The type of list items changes depending on the tag you use.
                              With the <ul> tag, you can create bulleted lists.

                              <ul>
                                        <li>HTML</li>
                                        <li>PHP</li>
                                        <li>Ruby</li>
                              </ul>
                              When elements are "nested" like this, the enclosing element becomes 
                              the parent and the enclosed elements become its children.

                              GO TO CSS SECTION

                              The Structure of HTML
                              In an actual HTML document, there are some rules you need to follow.
                              For example, the <head> and the <body> elements are required in 
                              the <html> element 

                              The <head> element contains information of the document while 
                              the <body> element contains the contents that are visible in the 
                              browser.

                              Specifying the HTML Version
                              In every HTML document, you need to start with the DOCTYPE 
                              declaration, which indicates the specific HTML version for your 
                              website.
                              We'll be using <!DOCTYPE html>, which is for HTML5, the 
                              latest version of HTML. Don't worry too much about the 
                              specific type, just remember that it's something you always 
                              have to specify.
                              
                              <head> Tag
                              The <head> element contains the settings of the HTML document 
                              that are not visible in the browser.
                              There are three elements you need to put in the <head> element.
                              Within the <head> element, we will specify 
                                        1) the character encoding, 
                                        2) the title of the website, and 
                                        3) the link to a CSS file.

                              <head>
                                        <meta charset="utf-8">

                                        <title> Progate </title>

                                        <link rel="stylesheet" href="stylesheet.css">
                              </head>

                              Character Encoding
                              By specifying the character encoding in the charset attribute 
                              as <meta charset="utf-8">, you can prevent the website from garbling.
                              UTF-8 is the recommended character encoding for HTML5.

                              Title for Your Website
                              The <title> element specifies the title of the document.

                              Linking a CSS file
                              You need to create a link between an HTML and CSS file by defining 
                              <link rel="stylesheet"> in the HTML.
                              You can specify the name of the CSS file using the href attribute.

                              The Layout
                              Layout is one of the most important parts of building a website.
                              The layout of the website we're going to build is made up of mainly 
                              three parts as shown below.
                                        Header, Main, Footer

                              <div> Tag
                              We're going to create the layout with <div> elements ("div" 
                              stands for "division"). The <div> tag is used to group elements.
                              In the example below, the layout is divided by three <div> elements 
                              with class names header, main, and footer.

                              <div class="header"> </div>
                              <div class="main"> </div>
                              <div class="footer"> </div>
