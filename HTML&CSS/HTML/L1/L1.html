                    How HTML Works
                    The first rule of writing HTML code is to surround text with tags.
                    Tags give a meaning, such as a heading or a link, to text.
                    <h1> Hello World </h1>

                    <a> Progate </a>

                    Opening and Closing Tags
                    Most HTML elements require a pair of tags, an opening tag 
                    and a closing tag, with text inserted in between.
                    When using closing tags, make sure to put /.

                    Heading Tags
                    Heading tags are used to format heading elements.
                    These tags range from <h1> to <h6>, <h1> being 
                    the largest and <h6> being the smallest (※ h stands for 
                    heading.).

                    Paragraph Tag
                    The <p> tag defines a paragraph (※ p stands for paragraph).
                    The text enclosed by tags such as <h2> and <p> begin on a 
                    new line.
                    <p> Hello </p>

                    Using Headings and Paragraphs
                    The <h1>...<h6> tags are used according to the size and 
                    importance of headings.
                    For text that is not a heading, let's use the <p> tag.

                    Comments
                    The text surrounded by <!-- --> becomes a comment.
                    Comments are not displayed in the browser, so they are 
                    useful for explaining your code.

                    <!-- this is a comment -->

                    <!-- 
                              Link Tag
                              You can easily create a link with the <a> tag (※ a stands 
                              for anchor).
                              The text in <a> tags is displayed in the browser as a link text.
                              <a> Home </a>

                              Every link has a destination.
                              So, in order to make any link work, you'll need to specify 
                              a destination URL in the <a> element by adding the href 
                              attribute.
                               <a href="url"> Home </a>

                               HTML Attributes
                              In HTML, you can specify an attribute like href in the opening tag.
                              Always put attribute values in double quotes.
                              href="url"> Home </a>

                     -->
           -->
