          Responsive Web Design
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices,
like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


-: Media Queries
They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

                    condition
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          css is applied wn condition matches
}

Using Media Queries
The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.

max-width and min-width
We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.

When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied 
only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when 
the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

h1 {
          color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          h1 {
                    color: blue;
          }
}

Breakpoints
The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called 
a breakpoint. We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, 
and 1000px for tablets.


-: Layout with Media Queries
In the previous lesson, we learned how to change the color of the text 
based on the width of the device. Now let's learn how to change the layout.

Changing the Width Using Media Queries
When you have several items in a row, they will look too small when 
displayed on smaller devices.
Let's fix this by changing the width of each item for smaller devices.

.item {
          width: 25%;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          .item {
                    width: 50%;
          }
}

i.e d width increases as d sizes decreases


-: box-sizing
Having four items with 25% width along with the 15px padding will 
cause the width to be greater than 100%, and so the last item will not fit.
We can fix this using box-sizing: border-box;.

How box-sizing Works
By setting the box-sizing property to border-box, an element's width 
will include the padding and the border.
Therefore, the layout will not break when you add padding or border 
(this is not the case with margin).

d total width = width + padding + border
                              25%       15px      2px

Applying CSS to All Elements
You can use the * selector when you want to apply CSS to all the elements.
It's a good practice to apply box-sizing: border-box; to all the elements 
because it will make it easier to adjust the layout of the web page.

* {
          box-sizing: border-box;
}


-:  Making Your Page Responsive
viewport
In preparation for applying Responsive Web Design to the page, let's 
set the viewport inside the <head> tag.
Without the viewport, the media queries will not function properly on 
tablets and smartphones.

<head>
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

width: 100%
In the previous lesson, we had the width fixed to 1170px, so it won't fit 
into devices with smaller screens.
Let's change the width to 100% so that it fills whatever the width for 
any device.

.container {
          /* Change the width to 100% */
          width: 100%;
          padding: 0 15px;
          margin: 0 auto;
}


-: Loading responsive.css
We could write our media queries in stylesheet.css, but we'll put them 
in a different file, responsive.css, to keep our CSS organized.
Make sure that you load responsive.css below the viewport.

The Width of lesson
Let's start with the layout for tablets.
With tablets, there isn't enough width to fit four lessons in one row.
Let's fix this by placing only two lessons in one row.
We can do this by changing the width of lesson to 50%.


-: Fixing the Background
Since we've changed the lessons to be shown in two rows, they no longer 
fit inside the section with the background color.
This is because the height of lesson-wrapper is fixed to 580px.
Let's remove this so that the height of lesson-wrapper will be determined 
by its children.

float and the Parent Element
By default, an element's height is determined by that of its children.
But this is not the case when all the child elements have float applied, 
in which case the height of the parent will be 0.
This is because the floating elements will not affect the parent.

Clearing the float
Let's learn how to add height to an element with floating children.
We can do this by adding an empty <div> tag with clear: left; applied.
clear: left; cancels the children's float state, so their height will affect 
the parent element's height.

<div class="lessons">
          <div class="clear"></div>
</div>

.clear {
          clear: left;
}


-: The Smartphone Layout
Now let's work on the layout for smartphones.
We'll set the breakpoint to 670px.
Let's first change the width of lesson to 100% to make a single 
column layout.

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .lesson {
                    width: 100%;
          }
}

Aligning the footer
Also, let's set the footer to align in the center when viewed from 
smartphone devices.

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .lesson {
                    width: 100%;
          }

          footer {
                    text-align: center;
          }
}


-: Adjusting the Buttons
Next, let's make the buttons spread to the full-width so that they are 
easier to tap. We'll also adjust the margin between the buttons.

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .btn {
                    width: 100%;
          }

          .facebook {
                    margin-bottom: 10px;
          }
}


-: Making the font-size Responsive
Smaller fonts will fit better in a smaller screen.
So, let's adjust the font for each device.

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .top-wrapper h1 {
                    font-size: 32px;
          }
}


-: Handling Large Screens
We've learned how to adjust the layout for smaller devices.
What about devices with larger screens?
For example, if we viewed our web page on a 2000px screen, the 
lessons will be too far apart from each other.

max-width
Since we've set the width of container to 100%, it will become too
big on a larger screen. We can fix this by setting the max-width.
In the example, we've set the max-width to 1170px, so the content 
inside will always be contained within this limit.

.container {
          max-width: 1170px;

          width: 100%;
}


-: Making the Header Responsive
To finish off, let's apply a different header for smartphones.
Since the whole menu won't fit, we'll display a menu icon instead.
(This way, you can display the menu when the icon is tapped.)

Hiding and Showing Elements
We'll hide the menu icon by default and only display it when 
the device width is 670px or less.
To hide an element, we can use display: none;.
To display a hidden element, we can use display: block;

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .header-right {
                    display: none;
          }

          .menu-icon {
                    display: block;
          }
}
