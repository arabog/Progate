<!-- 
-: Flexbox
Flexbox, is a CSS layout module
While this module has many properties, you'll focus 
on the most commonly used ones.


-: Creating a Horizontal Layout
What is display: flex?
Setting display: flex on an element will horizontally stack its children.

How to use display: flex
Any time you have items that you want to stack horizontally, set 
display: flex; on the parent element.

<ul class="'flex-list">
          <li class="='li1"></li>
          <li class="='li2"></li>
          <li class="='li3"></li>
          <li class="='li4"></li>
</ul>

.flex-list {
          display: flex;
}


-: Making the Elements(children) Full Width
When you set flex: auto on an element, it will expand to fill as much 
space as it can within the parent.

How to use flex: auto
If you have an element that you want to expand as much as it can 
within the parent element, set flex: auto on it.

<ul class="'flex-list">
          <li class="='li1"></li>
          <li class="='li2"></li>
          <li class="='li3"></li>
          <li class="='li4"></li>
</ul>

.flex-list {
          display: flex;
}

.flex-list li {
          flex: auto;
}


-: Wrapping the Elements Into Two Rows
By setting flex-wrap: wrap on d parent, a single row of elements will 
be able to wrap into multiple rows based on the element size.

How to use flex-wrap: wrap
Set flex-wrap: wrap on the parent of the elements that should be wrapped. 
The elements themselves will need to have the width set. This time, since 
we want to break the list into two rows, we'll set width: 50%.

<ul class="'flex-list">
          <li class="='li1"></li>
          <li class="='li2"></li>
          <li class="='li3"></li>
          <li class="='li4"></li>
</ul>

.flex-list {
          display: flex;
          flex-wrap: wrap;
}

.flex-list li {
          flex: auto;
          width: 50%;
}

Review of Percentage Size
Let's review using a percentage for the size of an element. When using 
a percentage % for the height or width of an element, the size of the 
element will become relative to the size of its parent.

.flex-list li {
          flex: auto;
          width: 50%;
}


-: Wrapping on Smaller Screens
Using Media Queries
To make a site responsive, we'll use media queries. We can make 
it so that the list only wraps when the screen width is small.

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          .flex-list {
                    flex-wrap: wrap;
          }

          .flex-list {
                    width: 50%;
          }
}


-: Using One Column for the Smallest Screens
Setting flex-direction: column makes all elements stack vertically instead 
of horizontally.

<ul class="'flex-list">
          <li class="='li1"></li>
          <li class="='li2"></li>
          <li class="='li3"></li>
          <li class="='li4"></li>
</ul>

.flex-list {
          flex-direction: column;
}

Centering Block Elements
Let's review how to center block elements. By setting margin: 0 auto and 
the width of an element, you can center it. Since we've already set the 
width of the elements for screens 1000px and under, we only need to 
set the margin here.

<ul class="'flex-list">
          <li class="='li1"></li>
          <li class="='li2"></li>
          <li class="='li3"></li>
          <li class="='li4"></li>
</ul>

.flex-list li {
          flex: auto;
          width: 50%;         and width: 50px has also been set for widths <=1000px

          margin: 0 auto;     ds is set on d elemt(child) and not parent
}

Using Media Queries
By using media queries, we can make it so that the list becomes a single 
column on the smallest of screen sizes.

@media (max-width: 670px) {
          .flex-list {
                    flex-direction: column;
          }

          .flex-list li {
                    margin: 0 auto;     //applies to d individual li's
          }
}
