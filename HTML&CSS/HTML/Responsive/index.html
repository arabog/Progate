          Responsive Web Design
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices,
like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


-: Media Queries
They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

                    condition
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          css is applied wn condition matches
}

Using Media Queries
The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.

max-width and min-width
We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.

When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied 
only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when 
the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

h1 {
          color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          h1 {
                    color: blue;
          }
}

Breakpoints
The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called 
a breakpoint. We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, 
and 1000px for tablets.
