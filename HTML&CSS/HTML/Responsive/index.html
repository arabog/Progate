          Responsive Web Design
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices,
like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


-: Media Queries
They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

                    condition
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          css is applied wn condition matches
}

Using Media Queries
The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.

max-width and min-width
We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.

When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied 
only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when 
the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

h1 {
          color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          h1 {
                    color: blue;
          }
}

Breakpoints
The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called 
a breakpoint. We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, 
and 1000px for tablets.


-: Layout with Media Queries
In the previous lesson, we learned how to change the color of the text 
based on the width of the device. Now let's learn how to change the layout.

Changing the Width Using Media Queries
When you have several items in a row, they will look too small when 
displayed on smaller devices.
Let's fix this by changing the width of each item for smaller devices.

.item {
          width: 25%;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          .item {
                    width: 50%;
          }
}
