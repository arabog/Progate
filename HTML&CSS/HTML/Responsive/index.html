          Responsive Web Design
Responsive Web Design makes your web page look good on all devices,
like desktops, tablets, and smartphones.


-: Media Queries
They allow you to specify different CSS depending on the size of the device.

                    condition
@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          css is applied wn condition matches
}

Using Media Queries
The syntax is as follows: @media (condition) { .... }.
The CSS inside { } will be applied only when the condition is met.

max-width and min-width
We can specify the max-width or the min-width as a condition.

When max-width: 1000px is specified, the CSS will be applied 
only when the width of the screen is 1000px or less.
On the other hand, with min-width the CSS will be applied when 
the width of the screen is the specified size or more.

h1 {
          color: red;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          h1 {
                    color: blue;
          }
}

Breakpoints
The value you specify for the max-width or the min-width is called 
a breakpoint. We'll be using 670px as the breakpoint for smartphones, 
and 1000px for tablets.


-: Layout with Media Queries
In the previous lesson, we learned how to change the color of the text 
based on the width of the device. Now let's learn how to change the layout.

Changing the Width Using Media Queries
When you have several items in a row, they will look too small when 
displayed on smaller devices.
Let's fix this by changing the width of each item for smaller devices.

.item {
          width: 25%;
}

@media (max-width: 1000px) {
          .item {
                    width: 50%;
          }
}

i.e d width increases as d sizes decreases


-: box-sizing
Having four items with 25% width along with the 15px padding will 
cause the width to be greater than 100%, and so the last item will not fit.
We can fix this using box-sizing: border-box;.

How box-sizing Works
By setting the box-sizing property to border-box, an element's width 
will include the padding and the border.
Therefore, the layout will not break when you add padding or border 
(this is not the case with margin).

d total width = width + padding + border
                              25%       15px      2px

Applying CSS to All Elements
You can use the * selector when you want to apply CSS to all the elements.
It's a good practice to apply box-sizing: border-box; to all the elements 
because it will make it easier to adjust the layout of the web page.

* {
          box-sizing: border-box;
}


-:  Making Your Page Responsive
viewport
In preparation for applying Responsive Web Design to the page, let's 
set the viewport inside the <head> tag.
Without the viewport, the media queries will not function properly on 
tablets and smartphones.

<head>
          <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
</head>

width: 100%
In the previous lesson, we had the width fixed to 1170px, so it won't fit 
into devices with smaller screens.
Let's change the width to 100% so that it fills whatever the width for 
any device.

.container {
          /* Change the width to 100% */
          width: 100%;
          padding: 0 15px;
          margin: 0 auto;
}
