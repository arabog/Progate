Learn Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson we will be making a website for a food ordering service.
Here we are going to learn about a concept called Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP) while making the ordering site.

-: What Is OOP?
"Object" means "thing" and "oriented" means "centered on"; 
Object-oriented is a way of thinking that focuses on objects. For 
example, you can think of a real shop or an e-commerce site as 
a combination of objects such as products, users, and carts.

What Are Objects in Programming?
In the programming world, there is a structure for reproducing 
objects in code. By structuring the code this way, the role of the 
code in relation to the objects becomes clearer to follow. Like 
assembly blocks, enabling you to code easily.

Objects
Let's take a look at the food ordering site we're going to create. 
We'll take each menu as an object and create an ordering site 
while assembling them.
