Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson, we'll continue to look at Object-Oriented 
Programming (OOP). While making new classes and 
learning how to combine them, we'll add a function 
to display reviews for the food ordering service that 
we created in PHP Study III.

-: Making a Details Page
From here, we'll be making a detail page (show.php) for 
each of the menus. In each detail page, we want to display 
the reviews for the item.

Making Links
To jump to the details page, we'll create a link with an <a> tag. 
We're going to link it to the page show.php.

index.php
<a href="show.php">
          <p> <?php echo $menu -> getName() ?> </p>
</a>
