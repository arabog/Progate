-: What is Java?
Java is a popular language that's used all around the world. 
You can develop all kinds of things using Java, like large scale 
systems, web applications, and mobile applications.

Let's Run Java
Let's write your first Java code. You'll be doing this in a file 
called Main.java. The first step is printing characters. By 
writing characters inside the () of System.out.println(), you 
can print them on the console.

-: Strings
In the last lesson, we printed characters in the console. In 
programming, a sequence of characters like "Hello Java", 
is known as a string. A string needs to be enclosed in double 
quotes ", or there will be an error.

System.out.println
System.out.println() is an instruction to print what's inside ().
In programming, you can give various instructions like this to 
a computer. Be familiar with System.out.println(), as you'll use 
it again and again in this lesson!

â€» The l in "println" is the lowercase letter of L.

class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello world");
          }
}
