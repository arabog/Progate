-: What is Java?
Java is a popular language that's used all around the world. 
You can develop all kinds of things using Java, like large scale 
systems, web applications, and mobile applications.

Let's Run Java
Let's write your first Java code. You'll be doing this in a file 
called Main.java. The first step is printing characters. By 
writing characters inside the () of System.out.println(), you 
can print them on the console.


class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello world");
          }
}

-: Strings
In the last lesson, we printed characters in the console. In 
programming, a sequence of characters like "Hello Java", 
is known as a string. A string needs to be enclosed in double 
quotes ", or there will be an error.

System.out.println
System.out.println() is an instruction to print what's inside ().
In programming, you can give various instructions like this to 
a computer. Be familiar with System.out.println(), as you'll use 
it again and again in this lesson!

â€» The l in "println" is the lowercase letter of L.

The Structure of Java
Every Java file has a class. Inside the class, there are methods.
In our example below, we have a Main class, and a main method.
For now, the only thing you have to remember is that you'll be 
writing your code inside the main method.


class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    //wrire code to be run here
          }
}

Semicolon
Java requires a semicolon ; at the end of every statement.
You'll get an error without it, so be careful!

Comments
We can also write comments in code using // at the beginning of 
a line. Comments will be ignored when running the code, so you 
can use them to leave notes.


-: Integers
You can use numbers like integers in programming. Unlike strings,
they don't need to be enclosed in quotes. You can add and subtract 
integers just like you do in math. Putting spaces before and after 
integers is not required, but it makes the code easier to read.

System.out.println(5 + 5); //10

Difference between Strings and Integers
Strings and integers are interpreted differently in programming.
5 + 2 will print 7, the result of the addition. However, if you make 
it a string by adding double quotes " like "5 + 2", the output will 
be the literal string: 5 + 2.

-: String Concatenation
The + that we used for calculations also lets us combine strings.
Combining strings is known as string concatenation. "5" + "3" 
will concatenate the two strings to become "53", instead of adding 
them as numbers. Try to always be aware of the difference between 
an integer and string.

class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    System.out.println("Hello world");

                    System.out.println(5 + 5);

                    System.out.println(5 % 3);

                      // Concatenate "38" and "19", and print it
                    System.out.println("38" + "19");
                    
                    // Add 38 and 19, and print it
                    System.out.println(38 + 19);
          }
}
