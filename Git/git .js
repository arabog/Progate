Let's Learn Git
When making a website, you may have to collaborate with others.
Git is a tool that'll help you to do team development smoothly.

Git Setup
Git is operated from the terminal.
First, to get started, you need to run the command git init.

git init
init is short for initialize


-: The Role of Git
These are the 3 steps to team development.
1. Make changes to a file
2. Prepare to share d changes
3. Share d change

Selecting Files to Share
To select a file, use the command git add file_name.

git add index.html


-: Recording Selected Files
We will save the selected files with a message. Then we are 
ready to share them.

git commit

To record a selected file, run the command git commit -m "message"
We call this kind of saving a commit. Well, it should describe the 
content of the commit. By the way, this message is called a 
commit message.

git commit -m 'create index.html'

With git add and git commit, the 2 commands we've 
already learned, you are ready to share files.
