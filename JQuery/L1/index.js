Getting Started with jQuery!
Welcome to the world of jQuery!
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript 
for building websites. You can create animations and design interactive 
web pages using jQuery.

jQuery, the JS Library
jQuery is a JavaScript library. It allows you to create various 
animation effects that HTML and CSS cannot accomplish alone. 
For example, jQuery can respond to events like clicks by hiding 
and showing HTML elements.
