-: Calculation:
Strings and Integers
console.log(5 + 2); will print out the result of the addition, 
which is 7. On the other hand, when you enclose 5 + 2 in 
quotes, it'll be printed as a string. Remember that strings 
and integers are different!


Multiplication and Division:
multiplication can be done using the asterisk * symbol and 
division can be done using the slash / symbol.

Remainders
Furthermore, the percentage % symbol can be used to find 
the remainder when dividing. 

-: Combining Strings
The + symbol can also be used to combine, or concatenate strings, 
as it's more generally known. "Ken" + " the Ninja" is printed as 
Ken the Ninja.

Differences between Strings and Integers
Let's look at an example of the difference between strings and integers.
"3" + "5" will become the string "35", but 3 + 5 will become 8.
This is why it's important to remember that strings and integers are 
completely different!

-: Variable
variable is a container (box) for data (values). The name attached to 
the box is the variable name, and the actual values (strings, numbers, 
etc.) are stored inside the box.


Variables are defined as let variableName = value. The = symbol in 
programming doesn't mean equal, but assign what's on the right side 
to the left side". let is a declaration that says "I'm going to define a 
variable", followed by the variable name and the value is assigned.
