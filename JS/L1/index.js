/*
-: Calculation:
Strings and Integers
console.log(5 + 2); will print out the result of the addition, 
which is 7. On the other hand, when you enclose 5 + 2 in 
quotes, it'll be printed as a string. Remember that strings 
and integers are different!


Multiplication and Division:
multiplication can be done using the asterisk * symbol and 
division can be done using the slash / symbol.
