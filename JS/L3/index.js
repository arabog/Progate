/* Whatâ€™s a Function?
A function is a set of instructions.

Defining a Function
To make a function, you need to define it. To define a function, 
writefunction() and then write what you want the function to do 
inside the braces {}

const functionName = function() {}

Calling Functions
Function definitions are necessary, but you have to call a function 
to actually use it. To call the function in the example below, just 
write introduce();.

const introduce = function() {
          console.log('Hello');
          console.log('I am Ken the Ninja');
}

introduce();
