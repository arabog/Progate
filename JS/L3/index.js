/* Whatâ€™s a Function?
A function is a set of instructions.

Defining a Function
To make a function, you need to define it. To define a function, 
writefunction() and then write what you want the function to do 
inside the braces {}

const functionName = function() {}

Calling Functions
Function definitions are necessary, but you have to call a function 
to actually use it. To call the function in the example below, just 
write introduce();.

const introduce = function() {
          console.log('Hello');
          console.log('I am Ken the Ninja');
}

introduce(
          

-: Assigning Functions
Let's take a closer look at functions. In the function definition above, 
we define functions by assigning them to a constant. 

const hello = function() {
          console.log('Hello!');
          console.log(' I am babs');
}

hello();


-: Arrow Functions
As shown below, it's also possible to define a function with () => 
instead of function(). This is an easier way of defining a function, 
which is a new feature of ES6. Functions defined this way are known 
as arrow functions.

const hello = () => {
          console.log('Hello!');
          console.log(' I am babs');
}

Arrow functions don't require any other changes to the definition 
besides replacing function with () =>. There's also no difference 
when you call functions defined this way.
