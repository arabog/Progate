Array Methods
Let's learn about methods for working with arrays! With these methods, 
you'll be able to easily handle data with JavaScript.
The methods we'll cover in this lesson are very useful and essential knowledge 
for practical JavaScript development.

push
The push method is used to add a new value to an array.
Put the new value you want to add to an array in () right after the word 
push. The example below adds the value 4 to the end of the numbers array 
by passing it as an argument to the push method.

const num = [1, 2, 3];
num.push(4);
