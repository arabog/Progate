In this lesson, we'll learn Sass which will allow you to write CSS 
(Cascading Style Sheets) more easily and efficiently.
Using Sass makes it easier to build any website, from a personal 
site to a large scale project. We'll start by gaining a firm grasp

What Is Sass?
Sass is a scripting language that allows you to write CSS in a more 
convenient and efficient way. There are two ways to write Sass, 
SASS syntax and SCSS syntax. At Progate, we use the SCSS syntax, 
which is the more common syntax. Note that the file extension 
is .scss rather than .css.

Why Sass?
Some of the benefits of using Sass are shown below.
-Less writing than CSS
- Allows you to re-use code

Nested Structures
First, let's look at the nesting structure that's used very often in Sass. 
With nesting, you can rewrite your CSS as shown in the example below. 
In this way, Sass allows you to nest selectors in other selectors. So, 
with Sass, you don't have to write the same selector many times.



-->
<div class="header">
          <ul>

          </ul>
</div>

css: have to write .header 2 times
.header {
          width: 100%;
}

.header ul {
          padding: 10px;
}


scss: only need to write header once
.header {
          width: 100%;

          ul {
                    padding: 10px;
          }
}

Benefits of Nesting
The larger a site becomes, the more useful nesting becomes. 
It's especially useful when making changes to class names. 
If you wanted to change the class name of the header in the 
example below, you would need to make changes in 3 places 
ith normal CSS, but with Sass you only need to make one change.

css
.header {
          width: 100%;
}

.header ul {
          padding: 10px;
}


.header li {
          font-size: 15px;
}

.scss
.header {
          width: 100%;

          ul {
                    padding: 10px;

                    li {
                              font-size: 15px;
                    }
          }
}
