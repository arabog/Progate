Using Sass makes it easier to build any website, from a personal site 
to a large scale project.
We'll start by gaining a firm grasp of the fundamentals of Sass!

What Is Sass?
Sass is a scripting language that allows you to write CSS in a more 
convenient and efficient way. There are two ways to write Sass, 
SASS syntax and SCSS syntax. At Progate, we use the SCSS syntax, 
which is the more common syntax. Note that the file extension 
is .scss rather than .css.

Why Sass?
Some of the benefits of using Sass are shown below.
-Less writing than CSS
- Allows you to re-use code

Nested Structures
First, let's look at the nesting structure that's used very often in Sass. 
With nesting, you can rewrite your CSS as shown in the example below. 
In this way, Sass allows you to nest selectors in other selectors. So, 
with Sass, you don't have to write the same selector many times.

<div class="header">
          <ul>

          </ul>
</div>

css: have to write .header 2 times
.header {
          width: 100%;
}

.header ul {
          padding: 10px;
}


scss: only need to write header once
.header {
          width: 100%;

          ul {
                    padding: 10px;
          }
}

Benefits of Nesting
The larger a site becomes, the more useful nesting becomes. 
It's especially useful when making changes to class names. 
If you wanted to change the class name of the header in the 
example below, you would need to make changes in 3 places 
ith normal CSS, but with Sass you only need to make one change.

css
.header {
          width: 100%;
}

.header ul {
          padding: 10px;
}


.header li {
          font-size: 15px;
}

.scss
.header {
          width: 100%;

          ul {
                    padding: 10px;

                    li {
                              font-size: 15px;
                    }
          }
}


-: Review of :hover
Before learning about the & symbol, let's review :hover and 
:active. The state in which the cursor is hovering over an 
element is known as hover. In CSS, with selector:hover, you 
can apply specific CSS when the cursor is over an element.

Review of :active
By using active with a selector, CSS can be applied only while 
an element is being clicked. This can be done with the 
syntax: selector:active.

The & Symbol
With nesting, you can rewrite selector:hover as &:hover, 
as shown below. Remember that & can be used in this way 
with any selector - hover, active, etc.

li {
          font-size: 15px;

          &:hover {
                    background-color: red;
          }
}


-: Applying CSS to Specific Elements
When you want to apply CSS to specific <li> tags like in the 
example below, you can use the syntax element.class-name. 
This syntax is often used for applying CSS to specific elements 
among many others.

<ul>
          <li>1</li>
          <li class="second">2</li>
          <li class="third">3</li>
</ul>

li {
          font-size: 14px;
}

li.second {
          color: red;
}

Referencing Specific Elements
In the previous page, you learned to reference specific elements 
easily with the & symbol in Sass. With normal CSS, you have 
to write the same element name repeatedly, but in Sass you can 
just write it once, so it's simple and easy to apply different CSS 
code to specific elements.

li {
          font-size: 14px;

          &.second {
                    color: red;
          }

          &.third {
                    color: blue;
          }
}


-: Variables
A variable is like a box that holds a value. They are 
especially useful in cases when the same value needs 
to be used many times.

Defining Variables
To use variables, you first need to define them. Variables 
are defined with the syntax: $variable-name: value; as 
shown below. You can think of it like saying put the value 
on the right into the variable on the left, this is called assignment.

$progate-color: #26546a;

How to Use Variables
Using variables is easy. Just write the variable name, i.e. 
$progate-color, as shown below. By writing the variable 
name in the place you want to use it, the value #26546a 
stored in the variable will be automatically be inserted. 
This makes it possible to reference the same value from 
different places, making it easy to change.

$progate-color: #26546a;

h1 {
          color: $progate-color;
}

p {
          color: $progate-color;
}

Placement of Variable Definitions
Note that a variable must be defined before the line where 
it is used. Since the style sheet (CSS) is read from the top 
down, if you define a variable after the line where you want 
to use it, an error will occur because it will be interpreted as 
an undefined variable.

Variable Scope
You can also specify the range in which variables can be used. 
This range is called scope. Even if you want to use a variable 
after defining it, you can't if it's outside of its scope. Therefore, 
for variables you want to use across the code, they should be 
defined in the outermost part of the nested structure.

h1 {
          $text: #26546a;
          color: $text; 
}

p {
          color: $text;       //error
}


-: What Are Mixins?
Now we'll look at mixins, which is a very powerful feature of Sass. 
A mixin is a function that allows you to combine multiple lines of 
code and easily re-use it. This removes the need to write the same 
code over and over and reduces duplicate code.

Defining mixins
To use a mixin you need to define it first. The syntax for defining 
a mixin is @mixin mixin-name {code} as shown in the example 
below.

@mixin lesson-card {
          width: 300px;
          padding: 40px;
}

Calling Mixins
Next, let's see how to use a mixin after it has been defined. You 
can use mixins in a Sass file with the syntax @include mixin-name;. 
When you use @include, the code from the mixin will be loaded into 
that area.


.lesson-1 {
          @include lesson-card;
}

-: mixins with Arguments
Information like color values can be passed to mixins as arguments. 
Arguments can be used to make your code more dynamic and are 
commonly used in programming. By passing color values and other 
data as arguments to a mixin, they can be used within the mixin


-->
Passing Data to Mixins
After adding arguments to a mixin definition, you can then pass 
in values to the mixin when calling it. The value #ff0000 is passed 
in and assigned to $color in the mixin, making your code more flexible.


@mixin font-data($color) {
          font-size: 14px;

          color: $color;
}

.card {
          @include font-data(#ff0000);
}

Wn u want to set d font color red, u av to set it after @include
@mixin font-data {
          font-size: 14px;

          color: #000000;
}

.card {
          @include font-data;
          color: red;
}

@mixin circle($color) {
          display: inline-block;
          border-radius: 50%;
          margin-left: 10px;
          text-align: center;
          background-color: $color;
}

.small {
          @include circle(#20efae);
          width: 34px;
          height: 34px;
}

.medium {
          @include circle(#61cbff);
          width: 62px;
          height: 62px;
}

.large {
          @include circle(#a070f7);
          width: 90px;
          height: 90px;
}


-: Functions
Functions are more or less universal in programming. You can 
use them in Sass to do things like "make a color 50% lighter" 
for example.

Common Useful Functions
Various functions are available in Sass. As a start, it's useful 
to remember some very common functions. Functions are 
commonly used to manipulate colors as shown below. There 
are many functions for the purpose of modifying colors.

color: darken(color, 50%);
color: lighten(color, 50%);
color: rgba(color, 0.5);

<div class="main">
          <ul>
                    <li class="blue1"></li>
                    <li class="blue2"></li>
                    <li class="blue3"></li>
          </ul>
          
          <ul>
                    <li class="pink1"></li>
                    <li class="pink2"></li>
                    <li class="pink3"></li>
          </ul>
</div>

$blue: #0ac4ff;
$pink: #fd6eb6;

.main {
          margin: 10px;
          
          li {
                    list-style: none;
                    float: left;
                    height: 100px;
                    width: 33%;
                    margin-bottom: 10px;
          }
          
          .blue1 {
                    background-color: $blue;
          }
          
          .blue2 {
                    // Use the darken function with the color $blue and the value 10%
                    background-color: darken($blue, 10%);
          
          }
          
          .blue3 {
                    // Use the darken function with the color $blue and the value 20%
                    background-color: darken($blue, 20%);
          }
          
          .pink1 {
                    background-color: $pink;
          }
          
          .pink2 {
                    // Use the lighten function with the color $pink and the value 10%
                    background-color: lighten($pink, 10%);
          }
          
          .pink3 {
                    // Use the lighten function with the color $pink and the value 20%
                    background-color: lighten($pink, 20%);
          }
}
