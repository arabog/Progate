          EJS= Embedded JavaScript
          EJS is a Node.js package that lets you embed JavaScript code in your HTML file.

          Using JavaScript
          To embed JavaScript code, we can use <% %> or <%= %>.
          <% %> is used in cases like defining a variable as it won't 
          be displayed. <%= %>, on the other hand, is used for cases 
          like printing a variable as it will be displayed.

          e.g:
           <% const item = {id: 4, name: 'tomatoes'} %;

          <%= {item.id} %>
          <%= {item.name} %>
