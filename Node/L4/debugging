Debugging means "to get rid of bugs". A bug is an 
occurrence when the program does not work in the 
intended manner. When program processes are 
stopped and errors occur, these are also known 
as bugs.

In other words, debugging is finding the origin 
of bugs and fixing them.


The Debug Process:
Step 1: Grasp and understand the details of the error.
Step 2: Predict the cause or origin of the error.
Step 3: Check your prediction step by step and confirm the issue. 

Welcome to the debugging course!
First, you'll learn how to debug step by step.

Que: Let's understand the details of the error!
An error message that contains the specific content of the error 
is being displayed (in d browser).

Next, we'll check the errors that are displayed in the terminal.

Error messages can contain information that is necessary for debugging
For example, this error message contains the location of where the error is triggered, as shown below.
TypeError: /home/progate/list-app/views/index.ejs:24

2. Let's predict the cause!
Think about the cause of the error and make your own predictions.
We're trying to use an iterative method on an array, but based on the content of the error message, we can assume that the foreach call may be wrong.


3. Let's see if our prediction is correct!
Let's check out the foreach method.
Check out the foreach method and find out what's wrong with it by doing the following:
ãƒ»Search for JavaScript foreach on the Web.

Can you find the mistake?
Rather than foreach, the correct method is forEach 
Now it's time to fix the code.
Fix the items.foreach part with the correct method.
