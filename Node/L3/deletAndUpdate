Setting Up the Route
We need to set up the route for deleting items. Since this makes changes to the database, we'll use post

<!-- since ds mks changes to d db we'll use post -->
app.post("/delete", (req, res) => {})


Using Forms
The delete button will not be created using a link but a form. You still use forms to make POST requests even when there's no value to submit so keep this in mind.

Let's Redirect
After submitting the form we'll display the list page. Since the delete feature makes changes to the database we'll use a redirect to display the list page.
i.e res.redirect('/index')
