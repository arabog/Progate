1. What is the Web?
The URL indicates the "server's location" as well as the "location of the 
information within the server"

2. Client and Server
A web page's HTML is stored in the server. The client that 
displays the HTML is called a browser.



Understanding More about Web Applications:
A website that is made purely with HTML is static, and will 
always show the same content unless the developer updates it.
