# -: Getting Started With Local Web Development
# 1. Local Development Environment
# First, let's break down the meaning of "local development environment":
# Local environment → your computer
# Development → to create something, such as a web application


# -: Ruby on Rails Server Setup (macOS)
# In this article, you will learn how to set up an environment 
# for Ruby on Rails in your own computer.

# In the Progate exercise screen, the Text Editor is the place 
# where you enter code, and the Terminal is the place where 
# you will see the result of the code execution.

# 2. Ruby Versions
# To check your version of Ruby, open the terminal and run the 
# command below:
rbenv versions

# 3. Installing Ruby on Rails
# Installing Rails is simple! Just run this command:
gem install rails -v 5.2.6

# Lastly, check your version of Rails. Run the command below:
rails -v

# 4. Creating a Rails App
# Let's create a new Rails application. As you learned in the Rails 
# lessons, use the command below to create a new application:
rails new app_name

# 5. Building a Local Rails Server
# First, move to app_name directory by running the following command:
cd app_name

# Just as we introduced in the Rails lessons, the command below 
# will build a Rails server:
rails s

# When you want to stop the Rails server, use the shortcut:
Control + C
