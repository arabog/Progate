# -: Getting Started With Local Web Development
# 1. Local Development Environment
# First, let's break down the meaning of "local development environment":
# Local environment → your computer
# Development → to create something, such as a web application


# -: Ruby on Rails Server Setup (macOS)
# In this article, you will learn how to set up an environment 
# for Ruby on Rails in your own computer.

# In the Progate exercise screen, the Text Editor is the place 
# where you enter code, and the Terminal is the place where 
# you will see the result of the code execution.

# 2. Ruby Versions
# To check your version of Ruby, open the terminal and run the 
# command below:
rbenv versions

# 3. Installing Ruby on Rails
# Installing Rails is simple! Just run this command:
gem install rails -v 5.2.6

# Lastly, check your version of Rails. Run the command below:
rails -v

# 4. Creating a Rails App
# Let's create a new Rails application. As you learned in the Rails 
# lessons, use the command below to create a new application:
rails new app_name

# 5. Building a Local Rails Server
# First, move to app_name directory by running the following command:
cd app_name

# Just as we introduced in the Rails lessons, the command below 
# will build a Rails server:
rails s

# When you want to stop the Rails server, use the shortcut:
Control + C


# -: Tackling Local Web Application Development
# You have finished your local development environment setup 
# by following the environment setup article and are now ready 
# to build your own web applications locally. Next let's think 
# about the following:
          1. What to create
          2. The overall plan for your project

# 1. Brainstorming What to Create
# First, you will need to decide what you want to create. If you try 
# to move forward without a clear vision, you will lose your sense 
# of direction and become lost before reaching your goal.

# However, it can be difficult to suddenly think of what to make. 
# One thing you could do is develop your own version of an 
# existing application. You may also be able to gain some 
# inspiration by looking at your surroundings in your everyday 
# life. Below are a few ideas you can start from:
          # Recreate a website that you often use
          # Alter a website that you are familiar with
          # Think of a web application that may be useful in your 
          # everyday life
          # Recreate the project that you created throughout this path

# 2. Outlining the Overall Plan
# In this step, let's draw out your project plan. A rough 
# sketch of the overall layout and screen transition diagram 
# is enough to get started. It is a very rough diagram that 
# depicts the application flow based on the user's actions.

# By drawing out the overall project plan, you will be able 
# to organize your project and also get a clearer picture of 
# the necessary processes involved. When the project plan 
# is detailed, it can also function as a blueprint, which 
# allows for a smoother development process when you 
# start to write out your code.

# 3. Final Note
# When developing applications in your own local 
# environment, there aren't any instructions, hints, 
# or answers like there are in the Progate lessons. 
# You may encounter many errors and hurdles that 
# prevent you from moving forward as planned. In 
# times like these, please review the Progate lessons 
# or look for information on the internet or in books 
# and solve the problem through trial and error. It 
# can be stressful and frustrating when things do not 
# move according to plan. However, when you finally 
# overcome these hurdles, you will be able to easily 
# recognize and troubleshoot the next time you 
# encounter similar problems.


# -: After the Web Development Course
# This article will introduce some new courses and 
# areas to be mindful of as you continue to grow and 
# move forward in your programming journey.

# Whether you wanted to land a job as a programmer, 
# gain a new skill, or create something from scratch, 
# you probably had certain goals or aspirations when 
# you decided to begin your programming journey.

# Your goal can be anything, such as:
          # Creating a web application that everyone can use
          # Developing a website for your friend's business
          # Creating your own blog site from scratch

# Please begin by setting a goal and continuing to push forward.

# These are just a few possibilities:
# Reviewing the Progate lessons
# Creating an application using Ruby on Rails
# Adding more features to your web application you 
# created in your local environment

# e.g) For the Tweet App
# - Implementing an image submission function
# - Implementing a user follow function

# Reading Technical Books


Programming and studying involves looking for answers 
yourself. Make sure you always keep this in mind.

Programming isn't something that you can just study once. It 
is a journey where you must continue learning and growing.
