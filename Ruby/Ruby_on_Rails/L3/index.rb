# Auto-Generated Columns
# id, created_at, updated_at are automatically added when a 
# table is created


# The id Column
# Let's look at the id column first. In the id column, a number 
# is automatically assigned when the data is saved to the database. 
# All ids are unique as they are incremented by 1 for each new 
# record/row.

# The created_at and updated_at Columns
# When a new record gets saved, the created_at and the 
# updated_at columns are automatically set to the current 
# date and time. The updated_at column will also be updated 
# each time you make changes to the data.
