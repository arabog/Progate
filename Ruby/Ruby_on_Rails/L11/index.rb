# :- Editing the Gemfile
# When encrypting passwords with Rails, something 
# known as a gem is required.

# gem
# A gem is a third-party library you can use with Ruby. 
# There are various gems such as "the search functionality 
# gem", or "the encrypt passwords gem". This time, we'll 
# use bcrypt, which is a gem to encrypt passwords.

# Gemfile
# In Rails, there's a file named Gemfile where you write 
# the gems you want to install, like gem 'gem_name'. 
# Some gems are already written when you run the rails 
# new command. When you install gems, the Gemfile.lock 
# file is automatically updated.

# Gemfile
gem 'rails', '5.0.3'
gem 'puma', '3.6.2'
gem 'sass-rails', '5.0.6'

# Gem Versions
# You can specify the version of the gem, like gem 'rails', '5.0.3'.
# If you don't specify a version, the latest version of the gem will 
# be installed.

gem 'rails', '5.0.3' #specify d version

gem 'puma' #install d latest version if noth is specified
