# Creating an Object
# To create an object, you first need to prepare its blueprint. 
# In programming terms, this blueprint is commonly known 
# as the class, and each object is known as an instance.

# Defining a Class
# Let's first prepare the blueprint by defining a class. Classes can 
# be defined with the following syntax: class ClassName. Bear in 
# mind that the class name has to start with a capital letter. Also, 
# don't forget to close the class definition using end like in methods.

# class Menu
          # some code
# end
