# Class Inheritance
# practical uses of classes 

# Let's create the Food and Drink classes, and have them 
# print different strings.

# If the menu item is a food, we will display its calorie, 
# but if it is a drink, we will display its volume!

# Using an Existing Class
# While we can create the classes from scratch, it's also 
# possible to use the Menu class as the base. This way, 
# we won't be repeating the same code in multiple places.
