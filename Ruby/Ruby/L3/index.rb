# Ruby Methods
# We'll be working with methods in this lesson.

# Methods
# A method lets you combine multiple lines of code into a single unit.

# Defining a Method
# Let's take a look at how to write methods. By writing def method_name 
# and end, and placing code in between them, 

def introduce
          puts "Hello"
          puts "I am Ken the Ninja"
end


# Calling a Method
# Methods are not executed just by defining them. You need to call them 
# when you want to use them. You can call a method simply by writing 
# the method name.

# Defining a Method
# Let's learn how to define a method from scratch. All you have to 
# know is that you must write the code you want to execute between 
# def method_name and end.

# def method_name 
          # some code
# end
