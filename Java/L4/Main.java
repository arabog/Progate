Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson we'll learn one of the most important programming paradigms, 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Object-orientation is more than just 
syntax â€” it's a way of thinking about how to create applications.

Why Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming makes our lives much easier. The 
larger a program becomes, the harder it gets to keep track of 
everything. Object-oriented programming makes it easy to build 
and modify even very large programs. So, it's essential for making 
applications.


-: Properties and Actions
Real-world objects all have properties and actions. For example, 
people have properties (e.g., name, age) and actions (e.g, walking, 
greeting). Software objects are modeled after real-world objects 
in that they also have properties and actions.

Classes and Instances
Classes and instances are two important object-oriented programming 
concepts. In fact, "instance" is another name for an object; and a "class" 
is a blueprint of an instance. 

Instance Properties and Actions
An instance has properties and actions and we define them in a class 
(instance's blueprint). Let's say we want to make a person instance 
with the properties name and age, and the actions greeting and 
walking. To do this, we'll define those in a Person class.

Summary of Classes and Instances
An instance is like an entity. The reason why an object is also 
called an instance is because it is an actual entity created from 
the blueprint (class).

class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Person person = new Person();
                    
                    person.hello();
          }
}

class Person {
          public void hello() {
                    System.out.println("Hello");
          }
}

class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
                    Person person = new Person();

                    person.hello();
          }
}
