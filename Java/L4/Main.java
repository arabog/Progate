Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson we'll learn one of the most important programming paradigms, 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Object-orientation is more than just 
syntax â€” it's a way of thinking about how to create applications.

Why Object-Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming makes our lives much easier. The 
larger a program becomes, the harder it gets to keep track of 
everything. Object-oriented programming makes it easy to build 
and modify even very large programs. So, it's essential for making 
applications.
